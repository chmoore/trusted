Among other things, you can verify the authenticity of the products registered in our database before you purchase them, by entering the manufacturer's serial number at our Site.

<strong><a name="collect" id="collect" class="anchored"></a>What Types of Information Do We Collect?</strong><br>
We may collect information about you directly or indirectly from your use of the Site and Services, as well as from other sources, such as  party business partners and affiliates. In general, we collect information as described below.
<br><br>
<u>Account Registration</u>: To use our Services, you must register at our Site. To register for an account, we may ask you to provide the following information: name, mailing address, phone number, fax number, email address, and your chosen user name and password. We then send you an e-mail to verify your account and e-mail address. 
<br><br>
<u>Payment Information</u>: You may purchase Trusted Services through our Site. Trusted also facilitates orders on behalf of certain of our Authorized Retailers, but we do not process any payments made to, or fulfil any orders placed with, those Authorized Retailers. Please review this policy carefully, and contact us if you have any questions. If you purchase a Trusted Service through our Site, we collect payment information from you, such as your credit or debit card number and other billing information necessary to process your payment. However, we will only use your credit card information to process or facilitate your payment. If you purchase an item from an Authorized Retailer, the Authorized Retailer may collect and process your credit card information in accordance with its billing practices; please note that Trusted merely facilitates your order from an Authorized Retailer; once you enter your information and purchase a product, you are dealing directly with the Authorized Retailer and your payment information, transaction and related activities, are subject to the policies of the Authorized Retailer, including any applicable privacy policy, terms of purchase, return policy, and the like. If you have any questions about an order you have placed with an Authorized Retailer, you should contact the Authorized Retailer directly. 
<br><em><strong>
All Trusted Authorized Retailers maintain their own payment processor; the Authorized Retailer, not Trusted, is processing your payment information for that product. </strong></em>
<br><br>
<u>Purchase Information/Supply Chain Information</u>: When you make a purchase through the Site or Services, whether from us or an Authorized Retailer, we collect information about your purchase, including your name, the name of the seller, description of the item, purchase price, and purchase date, which we may combine with the other information we have collected about you. We use this information to update our database of authentic products, and to analyze your purchasing or selling patterns and history. We may combine with the other personal information that we have collected about you. We also may obtain information from you through the supply chain, such as from manufacturers, distributors, or retailers even if you do not purchase products or Services through our Site. 
<br><br>
<u>Point-of-Sale Information</u>: In addition to our individual users, we have business clients that include retailers, manufacturers, distributors, designers, artists and others within the supply chain for authentic products; these clients register their authentic products in our database. When someone purchases an authentic product that has been registered with us, we receive certain information about the purchase known as "point-of-sale information" ("POS information"). The POS Information we receive includes name and contact information; the serial number for the authentic product; and other transaction details, including the date, amount, seller's name and related information. We use this information to update our database of authentic products. Authorized Retailers may use the information that they collect from you for other purposes; please refer to their own privacy policy to determine how they will use your POS Information. 
<br><br>
<u>Message Boards and User Forums</u>: Our Site allows you to post comments, opinions, or other content on message boards or other publicly accessible areas of the Site. This information may be viewed by other users of the Site, as well as public visitors to the Site. We may collect information about the content you post and may combine that information with other personal information that we collect about you. 
<br><br>
<u>Other Information</u>: We may also collect information about any inquiries or communication between you and Trusted or any communications we may receive from  parties about your use of the Site or Services, or about your use of our Services. We may combine this information with the other personal information we have collected about you. 
<br><br>
<u>Site Activities</u>: We use cookies and other tracking technologies to automatically collect information about you when you visit our Site or use our Services, including IP address, browser type, operating system, date and time of visit, time spent on and/or logged in to Site, pages visited, links clicked, and other Site activity. We may combine such site information with the personal information we have collected from users. Please see “How Do We Use Cookies &amp; Other Tracking Technologies“ below for additional information.

<ul>
<li style="list-style:disc;"><u>Affiliates and Business Partners.</u>Where permitted, we may disclose the information we collect from you to our affiliates or business partners.

<li style="list-style:disc;"><u>Service Providers.</u>We may disclose the information we collect from you to  party vendors, service providers, contractors or agents that perform functions on our behalf.

<li style="list-style:disc;"><u>Business Transfers.</u>If we are acquired by or merged with another company, if substantially all of our assets are transferred to another company, or as part of a bankruptcy proceeding, we may transfer the information we have collected from you to the acquiring company.  </li><br>
<li style="list-style:disc;"><u>Legal Process.</u> We may disclose the information we collect from you in order to comply with the law, a judicial proceeding, court order, subpoena or other legal process.</li><br>
<li style="list-style:disc;"><u>To Protect Us and Others.</u>  We also may disclose the information we collect from you where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the safety, rights or property of any person or party, or violations of our Terms of Use or this Privacy Policy.  </li>

<strong><a name="Tracking" id="tracking" class="anchored"></a>How Do We Use Cookies &amp; Other Tracking Technologies? </strong><br>
When you interact with the Site, we strive to make your experience easy and meaningful. We may use or engage others to use cookies, clear gifs and Flash LSOs to track user activity and collect site data. We may combine this data with other user information.
<br><br>
<em><strong>Cookies</strong></em>. When you come to the Site, our web server sends a cookie to your computer. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in future. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Site visitors who disable their web browsers' ability to accept cookies will be able to browse the Site; however, you must enable cookies to use most of our Services.
<br><br>
<em><strong> Third Party Analytics</strong></em>. We also may engage  parties, including, without limitation, Google Analytics, to track and analyze non-personally identifiable Site data. We use the data collected by such  parties to help us administer and improve the quality of the Site and Services and to analyze usage. We do not have access to or control over these  party cookies nor does this Privacy Policy cover such  parties' use of data.
<br><br>
<em><strong>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</strong></em>.We or the  parties we engage to track and analyze Site data may employ clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs) to help us better manage content on the Site. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer's hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages.
