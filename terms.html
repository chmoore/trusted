			<br>
			Some jurisdictions may not allow the exclusion or limitation of implied warranties or conditions, or allow limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts, so the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to you. In such event, Trusted's warranties and conditions with respect to the Site and Services will be limited to the greatest extent permitted by applicable law in such jurisdiction.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&nbsp;

You receive eTitles at your own risk.</em></p>

			<strong>13. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY&nbsp;</strong><br>
			<br>
			UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL THE TRUSTED PARTIES BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, RELIANCE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR YOUR USE OF THE SITE, EVEN IF A TRUSTED PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&nbsp;<br>

			<br>
			<strong>14. LIMITED TIME TO BRING YOUR CLAIM&nbsp;</strong><br>
			<br>
			Where permitted by law, you and Trusted agree that any cause of action arising out of or related to the Site or any Site Information must be commenced within one (1) year after the cause of action accrues. Otherwise, such cause of action is permanently barred.&nbsp;<br>
			<br>
			<strong>15. LINKS&nbsp;</strong><br>
			<br>
			The Site may provide, or third parties may provide, links to other websites or resources. Because Trusted has no control over such websites or resources, you acknowledge and agree that Trusted is not responsible for the availability of such external websites or resources, and does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for any content, advertising, products or other materials on or available from such sites or resources. Trusted assumes no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices by such third-party websites. By using this Site, you expressly waive any rights, claims or liability against Trusted from your use of any third-party website, including third-party payment processors.&nbsp;<br>
			<br>
			<strong>16. TERMINATION&nbsp;</strong><br>

			<br>
			<strong>18. BINDING ARBITRATION</strong>&nbsp;<br>
			<br>
			<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 18.1.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Purpose</strong>. If you have a Dispute (as defined below) with Trusted that cannot be&nbsp;<strong>resolved</strong>&nbsp;through an informal dispute resolution with Trusted, you or Trusted elect to arbitrate that Dispute in accordance with the terms of this Dispute Resolution provision rather than litigate the Dispute in court. Arbitration means you will have a fair hearing before a neutral arbitrator instead of in a court by a judge or jury.&nbsp;<br>
			<br>
			<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 18.2.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Definitions</strong>. The term "Dispute" means any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Trusted regarding any aspect of your relationship with Trusted, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, negligence, or any other intentional tort), or any other legal or equitable theory, and includes the validity, enforceability or scope of this Dispute Resolution provision (with the exception of the enforceability of the class action waiver clause provided in this paragraph). "Dispute" is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced. As used in this Dispute Resolution provision, "Trusted" means Trusted and its parents, subsidiaries and affiliated companies and each of their respective officers, directors, employees and agents.&nbsp;<br>
			<br>
			<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 18.3. Right to Opt Out of Arbitration.</strong>&nbsp;IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE BOUND BY THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION, YOU MUST NOTIFY TRUSTED IN WRITING WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THE DATE THAT YOU FIRST ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT BY SENDING NOTICE TO:&nbsp;<strong>Trusted, ATTN</strong>:&nbsp;<strong>Legal Department,</strong>11950 Democracy Drive, Suite 300, Reston, Virginia 20190. YOUR WRITTEN NOTIFICATION TO TRUSTED MUST INCLUDE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS AS WELL AS A CLEAR STATEMENT THAT YOU DO NOT WISH TO RESOLVE DISPUTES WITH TRUSTED THROUGH ARBITRATION. YOUR DECISION TO OPT OUT OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION WILL HAVE NO ADVERSE EFFECT ON YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH TRUSTED OR THE DELIVERY OF SERVICES TO YOU BY TRUSTED. IF YOU HAVE PREVIOUSLY NOTIFIED TRUSTED OF YOUR DECISION TO OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION, YOU DO NOT NEED TO DO SO AGAIN.&nbsp;<br>
			Initiation of Arbitration Proceeding/Selection of Arbitrator. If you or Trusted elect to resolve your Dispute through arbitration pursuant to this Dispute Resolution provision, the party initiating the arbitration proceeding may initiate the arbitration proceeding with American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), 335 Madison Ave., Floor 10, New York, NY 10017-4605, 1-800-778-7879,&nbsp;<a href="mailto:www.adr.org">www.adr.org</a>&nbsp;under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the AAA.&nbsp;<br>
			<br>
			<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 18.4. Arbitration Procedures.</strong>&nbsp;Because the Service(s) provided to you by Trusted concerns interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA"), not state arbitration law, shall govern the arbitrability of all Disputes. However, applicable federal law or the law of the state where you receive the service from Trusted may apply to and govern the substance of any Disputes. Any state statutes pertaining to arbitration shall not be applicable under this Dispute Resolution provision.&nbsp;<br>
			<br>
			If there is a conflict between this Dispute Resolution provision and the rules of the arbitration organization chosen, this Dispute Resolution provision shall govern. If the arbitration organization that you select will not enforce this Dispute Resolution provision as written, it cannot serve as the arbitration organization to resolve your dispute with Trusted. If this situation arises, the parties shall agree on a substitute arbitration organization. If the parties are unable to agree, the parties shall mutually petition a court of appropriate jurisdiction to appoint an arbitration organization that will enforce this Dispute Resolution provision as written. If there is a conflict between this Dispute Resolution provision and the rest of this Agreement, this Dispute Resolution provision shall govern.<br>
			<br>
			A single arbitrator will resolve the Dispute. You should know that participating in arbitration may result in limited discovery depending on the rules of the arbitration organization that is chosen to resolve the Dispute. The arbitrator will honor claims of privilege recognized by law and will take reasonable steps to protect customer account information and other confidential or proprietary information.&nbsp;<br>
			<br>
			The arbitrator will make any award in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. An award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement.&nbsp;<br>
			<br>
			If an award granted by the arbitrator exceeds $75,000, either party can appeal that award to a three-arbitrator panel administered by the same arbitration organization by a written notice of appeal filed within thirty (30) days from the date of entry of the written arbitration award. The members of the three-arbitrator panel will be selected according to the rules of the arbitration organization. The arbitration organization will then notify the other party that the award has been appealed. The three-arbitrator panel will issue its decision within one hundred and twenty (120) days of the date of the appealing party's notice of appeal. The decision of the three-arbitrator panel shall be final and binding, except for any appellate right which exists under the FAA.&nbsp;<br>
			<br>
			<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 18.5. Restrictions:</strong>&nbsp;YOU MUST CONTACT US WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR OF THE DATE OF THE OCCURRENCE OF THE EVENT OR FACTS GIVING RISE TO A DISPUTE, OR YOU WAIVE THE RIGHT TO PURSUE ANY CLAIM BASED UPON SUCH EVENT, FACTS, OR DISPUTE.&nbsp;<br>
			<br>
			ALL PARTIES TO THE ARBITRATION MUST BE INDIVIDUALLY NAMED. THERE SHALL BE NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY CLAIMS TO BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON A CLASS ACTION OR CONSOLIDATED BASIS OR ON BASES INVOLVING CLAIMS BROUGHT IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON BEHALF OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC (SUCH AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL), OTHER SUBSCRIBERS, OR OTHER PERSONS SIMILARLY SITUATED UNLESS THE STATUTE UNDER WHICH YOU ARE SUING PROVIDES OTHERWISE.&nbsp;<br>
			<br>
			ALL PARTIES WAIVE ANY CLAIM TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR MULTIPLIED DAMAGES ARISING FROM OR OUT OF ANY DISPUTE WITH TRUSTED UNLESS THE STATUTE UNDER WHICH THEY ARE SUING PROVIDES OTHERWISE.&nbsp;<br>
			<br>
			<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 18.6. Location of Arbitration</strong>. The arbitration will take place in Fairfax County, Virginia.&nbsp;<br>
			<br>
			<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 18.7. Payment of Arbitration Fees and Costs</strong>. TRUSTED WILL ADVANCE ALL ARBITRATION FILING FEES AND ARBITRATOR'S COSTS AND EXPENSES UPON YOUR WRITTEN REQUEST GIVEN PRIOR TO THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE ARBITRATION. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL ADDITIONAL COSTS THAT YOU INCUR IN THE ARBITRATION, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ATTORNEYS OR EXPERT WITNESSES. IF THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDING IS DECIDED IN TRUSTED'S FAVOR, YOU SHALL REIMBURSE TRUSTED FOR THE FEES AND COSTS ADVANCED TO YOU ONLY UP TO THE EXTENT AWARDABLE IN A JUDICIAL PROCEEDING. IF THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDING IS DETERMINED IN YOUR FAVOR, YOU WILL NOT BE REQUIRED TO REIMBURSE TRUSTED FOR ANY OF THE FEES AND COSTS ADVANCED BY TRUSTED. IF A PARTY ELECTS TO APPEAL AN AWARD TO A THREE-ARBITRATOR PANEL, THE PREVAILING PARTY IN THE APPEAL SHALL BE ENTITLED TO RECOVER ALL REASONABLE ATTORNEYS' FEES AND COSTS INCURRED IN THAT APPEAL. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION, TRUSTED WILL PAY ALL FEES AND COSTS THAT IT IS REQUIRED BY LAW TO PAY.&nbsp;<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
			<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 18.8. Severability.&nbsp;</strong>If any clause within this Dispute Resolution provision (other than the class action waiver clause identified above) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this Dispute Resolution provision, and the remainder of this Dispute Resolution provision will be given full force and effect. If the class action waiver clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable, the entire Dispute Resolution provision will be unenforceable, and the dispute will be decided by a court. In the event this entire Dispute Resolution provision is determined to be illegal or unenforceable for any reason, or if a claim is brought in a Dispute that is found by a court to be excluded from the scope of this Dispute Resolution provision, you and Trusted have each agreed to waive, to the fullest extent allowed by law, any trial by jury.&nbsp;<br>
			<br>
			<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 18.9. Exclusions from Arbitration.</strong>&nbsp;YOU AND TRUSTED AGREE THAT THE FOLLOWING WILL NOT BE SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION: (1) ANY CLAIM FILED BY YOU OR BY TRUSTED THAT IS NOT AGGREGATED WITH THE CLAIM OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER AND WHOSE AMOUNT IN CONTROVERSY IS PROPERLY WITHIN THE JURISDICTION OF A COURT THAT IS LIMITED TO ADJUDICATING SMALL CLAIMS; (2) ANY DISPUTE OVER THE VALIDITY OF ANY PARTY'S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS; AND (3) ANY DISPUTE RELATED TO OR ARISING FROM ALLEGATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH UNAUTHORIZED USE OR RECEIPT OF A SERVICE.&nbsp;Either party may bring a lawsuit for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Service, or intellectual property infringement, without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described above</p>
		<p>
			<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 18.10. No Class Actions.</strong> You agree that you may only resolve disputes with Trusted on an individual basis, and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action. Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations are not allowed under these Terms of Service.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;
			</p>
		<p>
			<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 18.11. Continuation</strong>. This Dispute Resolution provision shall survive the termination of your customer relationship with Trusted.&nbsp;<br>
			<br>
			<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 18.12. SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING ARBITRATION FOR CALIFORNIA AND/OR WASHINGTON STATE CUSTOMERS</strong>: IF YOU ARE A TRUSTED CUSTOMER IN CALIFORNIA AND/OR WASHINGTON STATE, TRUSTED WILL NOT SEEK TO ENFORCE THE ARBITRATION PROVISION ABOVE UNLESS WE HAVE NOTIFIED YOU OTHERWISE.&nbsp;<br>
			<br>
			<strong>19. JURISDICTION, VENUE &amp; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL&nbsp;</strong><br>
			<br>
			This Agreement and all claims or issues regarding the Site shall be governed according to the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, to the exclusion of its conflict of law provisions. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods of April 11, 1980, shall be excluded.&nbsp;<br>
			<br>
			Except in those cases where contractual attribution of jurisdiction is not enforceable on the User as a consumer, any disputes that may arise concerning the formation, interpretation or performance of this Agreement which are not amicably resolved or resolved by arbitration, shall be brought in state or federal court in Fairfax County, Virginia and you consent to the jurisdiction of such courts.&nbsp;<br>
			<br>
			<strong>TO THE EXTENT NOT OTHERWISE PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PARTIES HERETO AGREE TO WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY MATTERS ARISING UNDER OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT WHICH ARE NOT RESOLVED BY ARBITRATION.&nbsp;</strong><br>
			<br>
			<strong>20. ENTIRE AGREEMENT, NOTICE, WAIVER, AND SEVERABILITY.&nbsp;</strong><br>
			<br>
			This Agreement constitutes the entire Agreement between you and Trusted in connection with the Site or Services and supersedes all prior agreements between you and Trusted regarding the subject matter contained herein. If any provision of this Agreement is found invalid or unenforceable, that provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent possible, and the other provisions contained herein will remain in full force and effect. No failure of either party to exercise or enforce any of its rights under this Agreement will act as a waiver of such rights. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as creating or constituting a partnership, joint venture, agency or other like relationship between you and Trusted or any of the Trusted Parties.&nbsp;<br>
			<br>
			The failure of Trusted to insist upon performance of any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, or the waiver of any breach of, or the decision to not exercise any of its rights under, any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement, shall not be construed as thereafter waiving any such terms and conditions, or any other terms and conditions of this Agreement. Any waiver must in writing and signed by Trusted.</p>
